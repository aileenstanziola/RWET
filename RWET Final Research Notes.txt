- Stein’s style is to writing what sushi is to cooking—not so much an example as a repudiation of the whole idea that still manages to serve the original function.
In truth, though, her style is more coherent and “ordinary” than it can seem, in part because a lot of its effect is achieved by the ridiculously straightforward device of removing normal punctuation.  

- In writing, our sensitivity to small sounds is such that a minute alteration in decorum can have a very big effect on tone.*

- commaless, undivided form makes her thoughts seem plain even when they are very fancy.

- * Reading Stein is a bit like reading Emily Dickinson before punctuation got imposed on her: both claim, in every sense, our undivided attention.*

- “The essence of being civilized is to posses yourself as you are.”

- “Uncle Charles Principle” - a narrative voice that adopts not just the idiomatic phrases, but also the speech rhythms, syntax and attitudes representative of the characters. 

- In Three Lives - This poetic, lyrical voice is different from Anna’s rough, ungrammatical one — it may be Anna’s subconscious revealing her suppressed feelings 

- Overuse the verb “to be” 
a) as a linking verb followed by an adverb, then an adjective (This one little house was always very full)

b) as a linking verb followed by a noun (for they [houses] were built along a street) 

** linking constructions are followed by the passive ones 

- The use of the word ‘like’ - In Melanctha, “like” is repeated ad infinitum throughout the story (look this up)

- In these Stein posited the existence of a second, unconscious personality which exhibits itself through unconscious, motor-automatic responses to sight, sound and so forth……
(Look up Gertrude Stein, “Normal Motor Automatism” Psychological Review)

- “A marked tendency to repetition” - in consciousness itself: a word or phrase will lodge in consciousness and keep repeating itself at every opportunity

- “Repetitive, stream-of-consciousness style”

- Uses repetition to reveal the thoughts, attitudes and emotions of the characters 

- Hemingway parsed Stein’s modernism: he had broken it down into its constituent parts, adapted it and made it his own

- the poetics of presence: a particularly enticing exegetical strategy because the reader is from the outset set adrift on a shifting sea of verbal flotsam without either compass, sail or anchor
